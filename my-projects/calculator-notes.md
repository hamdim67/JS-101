//Ask for first number
//Ask for second number
//Ask user for operation
//Perform the calculation
//Display the result

//Bonus feature #1:
//Ask for another calculation
//Algorithm for this

//Ask user 'Would you like to perform another calculation'?
//Wait for input
//If input is 'yes', start new calculation using 'continue'
//enclose entire code in while() loop to loop back to beginning
//If input is 'no', exit out of calculator w/ 'break'

//Bonus feature #2:

//Move calculator messages to JSON file
//Access the messages by key by making an object with
//Access with require() method

//Number Validation (make a function that will check for
//valid number, and then make a loop (a while loop, in this case)
//that will check each input to see if it meets the requirements

//Here, we check if the number is NOT valid
//If it is NOT valid, then we ask for more input (in a loop)
//until we get a valid number to move on with the program

//input from readline-sync is ALWAYS a string
//so we need to change num1 and num2 to numbers

//Refactoring: Change if/else to switch statement
